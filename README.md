<h1>The v Programming Language</h1>
</div>

## Key Features of v

- Similar to c++: anyone that program in c++ can easily program in v
- Easy to develop: v compiles itself in less than a second
- Usefull escape sequences like `\hw` that expands to `'Hello World'`

## Usage

Run the compiler like so:
````
v hw.v
````
This will generate an executable file called `hw` that prints the string `'Hello World'`.

## Challenge

Can you find a secret text by executing a vesion of the `v` command that was generated by compiling a file `v.v` that is almost identical to the one on this repository, only with the secret text instead of the `********` on line 9?
