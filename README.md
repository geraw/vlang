<h1>The v Programming Language</h1>
</div>

## Key Features of v

- Similar to c++: anyone that program in c++ can easily program in v
- Easy to develop: v compiles itself in less than a second
- Usefull escape sequences like `\hw` that expands to `'Hello World'`

## Usage

Run the compiler like so:

    ````
    v hw.v
    ````
This will generate an executable file called `hw` that prints the string `'Hello World'`.
